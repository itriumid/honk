# Agent instructions

## Handbook — check this first

Conventions and cross-project decisions live in `.handbook/`, a local symlink to the
`agent-handbook` repository. **They are mandatory, and they override your defaults.**

If `.handbook/` is missing, empty, or unreadable: **stop and say so.** Tell the user to run
`agent-handbook/scripts/link.sh` against this repository. Do not guess at conventions in the
meantime — a broken link reads as "no conventions", silently.

## Always

These apply to every task.

- **Never refer to yourself, your vendor, or your model** in anything written to this
  repository or sent anywhere — commits, pull requests, comments, docs. No `Co-Authored-By:`
  trailer, no "generated with", no tool names. Several tools add these by default; override the
  default. A required check fails the pull request if you don't.
- **Do not commit, push, open a pull request, or merge unless explicitly asked.** Leave changes
  in the working tree and say what you changed. Approval for one is not approval for the next.
- **Never write through `.handbook/`.** It's a different repository — read it, never write it.
- **Never force-push, amend a pushed commit, or skip a hook or check** (`--no-verify`). Fix the
  underlying problem.
- **Never disable, weaken, or skip a failing lint rule, type check, or test.** Fix what it
  caught, or say the check itself is wrong and ask.
- **Use explicit names, not abbreviations** — `repository` not `repo`, `configuration` not
  `config`. Terms of art (`API`, `URL`, `ID`) and tool-dictated filenames are exempt.

## Read these when the task calls for it

Don't load them upfront; read the one that applies.

| Unsure what an agent may write or do here (catch-all)                                         | `.handbook/conventions/rules/ai-agents.md`           |

| Wondering why a cross-project technology choice was made                                      | `.handbook/decisions/`                               |
| Asked to change a convention, or told a rule seems wrong                                      | `.handbook/conventions/background/`                  |

`.handbook/conventions/background/` is rationale, not instructions. Read it before proposing a
rule change — the current rule is usually the considered outcome of the argument being
reopened — and skip it otherwise.

## This repository

Honk is a desktop soundboard: Tauri 2 with a SvelteKit (static adapter, TypeScript) frontend,
and a Rust backend. The README's **Architecture** and **Design** sections are the source of
truth for the plan and the design tokens — read them before building a feature.

- **Audio plays in Rust, never in the webview.** Don't reach for `<audio>` or the Web Audio API.
- **Colours come from the tokens in `src/app.css`.** Never hard-code a hex value in a component.
  Text on `--accent` is always `--on-accent`.
- **Hotkeys are never imported from a shared library by default** — see the README's import rules.

### Commands

| What | Command |
|---|---|
| Install | `pnpm install` |
| Run the app | `pnpm tauri dev` |
| Type-check the frontend | `pnpm check` |
| Build the frontend | `pnpm build` |
| Check the Rust side | `cargo check` (from `src-tauri/`) |

Before calling a change done, run `pnpm check`, `pnpm build`, and `cargo check` — all three,
even for a change that only looks like it touches one side.

### Environment gotchas

- `cargo` may not be on `PATH` in a non-interactive shell: run `. "$HOME/.cargo/env"` first.
- Node is lazy-loaded through shell functions in the owner's zsh setup. If `node` or `pnpm`
  resolves to a function instead of a binary, run
  `unfunction node npm npx pnpm; . "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"`.
